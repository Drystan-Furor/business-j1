                                        When it comes to the usability of a website, the focus of your
                                        visitors is on one important component: The Navigation System
                                        of the site. To make all posts easy accessible to the visitors,
                                        the Navigation System provides a Blog Explorer module. The explorer
                                        module supports the users for browsing articles by sorting criteria
                                        like category and date or browsing the archive for all articles.

  something went  wrong with the layout definitions. Check  the
  output of the Jekyll engine building this site.

  Check the  contents   of folder _layouts. Verify  if the base
  layout  "{{ page.layout }}" exists  and the  referring  chain
  (inheritance) is correct.

  If you see this page within the J1 Template DEVELOPMENT system,
  re-run a site built running:

    yarn rebuild site

  If you're on a RUNTIME system run a built like so:

    yarn rebuild

  and open the website again by:

    yarn site
