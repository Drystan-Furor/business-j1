Thankfully there is a sweet service called IFTTT (which stands for If This Then That). IFTTT is a great service to automate actions between two different apps using recipes that follow the simple statement of, if this then that. I’ve created a couple of recipes that helps automate some of my social networking.

Prior to discovering IFTTT, after I published a post, I would grab the URL and
the title and open Twitter and LinkedIn and publish my new post there. Although
it’d take me but five minutes or less to do this, I wanted to remove that step
altogether from my posting workflow.

To accomplish this, I use recipes that are made up of watching my site’s RSS feed for new items, since Jekyll automatically creates a RSS file. When a new item is found, then IFTTT creates a new update using the title and URL and post it up to their respective social media accounts.

Here’s step-by-step how I’ve created the Twitter IFTTT recipe

RSS Feed integrations
The RSS Feed service lets you turn on and make Applets for RSS and Atom web feeds. When the content you care about goes live, stay up-to-date with notifications, emails, and


1. Choose a service --> RSS

2. Choose a trigger (If) --> New feed item

* Feed URL https://jekyll.one/assets/data/feeds/feed.xml

3. Then That (add) --> Twitter --> Post a tweet

* Add Twitter account details

4. Continue to Review and finish

If New feed item from https://jekyll.one/assets/data/feeds/feed.xml, then Post a tweet to @jurgen_adams
